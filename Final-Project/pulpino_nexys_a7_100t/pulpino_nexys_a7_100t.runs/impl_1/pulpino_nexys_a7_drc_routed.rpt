CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning

DPIP-1#3 Warning

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP pulpino_inst/core_region_i/CORE.RISCV_CORE/ex_block_i/multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_ext output pulpino_inst/core_region_i/CORE.RISCV_CORE/ex_block_i/multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_ext/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP pulpino_inst/core_region_i/CORE.RISCV_CORE/ex_block_i/multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_ext multiplier stage pulpino_inst/core_region_i/CORE.RISCV_CORE/ex_block_i/multdiv_fast.multdiv_i/mac_res_ext/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	ja_IBUF[3]_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to G17
	ja_IBUF_BUFG[3]_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y0

REQP-1839#20 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 pulpino_inst/core_region_i/data_mem/sp_ram_i/byte_write[1].sp_ram_reg_0_0 has an input control pin pulpino_inst/core_region_i/data_mem/sp_ram_i/byte_write[1].sp_ram_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: pulpino_inst/core_region_i/data_mem/sp_ram_i/ADDRARDADDR[12]) which is driven by a register (pulpino_inst/core_region_i/data_mem_axi_if/axi_mem_if_SP_i/Slave_r_buffer_LP/buffer_i/FSM_sequential_CS_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
